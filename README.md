# Hi, I’m **Elijah Jacob** 

— a tech enthusiast, problem solver, and entrepreneur passionate about building solutions that make a difference. I recently graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Economics and Data Science, and I'm eager to leverage my technical skills and innovative mindset in real-world applications. This repository showcases some of the key projects I've been working on, reflecting my expertise in software development, data science, and engineering.

## 🚀 **Featured Projects in This Repository**

Here are four of my recent projects available in this repository:

1. **[Blocks: A Puzzle Game (Java)](link-to-your-repo)**
   - **Blocks** is a Java-based puzzle game where players manipulate blocks to solve various challenges. The game features a graphical user interface (GUI), custom game logic, and sound effects to create an engaging and interactive experience. Players can test their critical thinking and problem-solving skills across multiple difficulty levels. The project emphasizes modularity and extensibility, allowing for easy addition of new levels and features.

2. **[Enigma Machine Simulator (Java)](link-to-your-repo)**
   - This project is a Java implementation of an Enigma machine simulator, inspired by the encryption machine used by the German military during World War II. The simulator supports encryption and decryption of messages with configurable rotors, reflectors, and plugboards. The project showcases my ability to work with complex algorithms, implement detailed command-line interfaces, and manage file input/output operations for processing cryptographic data.

3. **[Ataxx: A Strategy Game (Java)](link-to-your-repo)**
   - **Ataxx** is a Java-based strategy board game that includes both a graphical user interface (GUI) and text-based interaction modes. Players compete to control the board by moving pieces and blocking opponents, with options for AI play and varying difficulty settings. The project demonstrates my skills in Java programming, GUI development, and implementing game logic algorithms.

4. **[Gitlet: A Tiny Version-Control System (Java)](link-to-your-repo)**
   - **Gitlet** is a simplified version-control system inspired by Git, implemented in Java. It allows users to manage file versions, track changes, and collaborate on projects using a command-line interface. Key features include branching, merging, commit logging, and file restoration. This project highlights my understanding of version control concepts and showcases my ability to build complex software systems from scratch.

## 🔧 **Core Skills and Expertise**

- **Programming Languages**: Java, Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow), SQL  
- **Software Development**: Java GUI development, object-oriented programming, command-line interfaces
